In this case 3DS authentication is required on the merchant's site.

Subsequent payments are initiated by the merchant and the customer is not present for these purchases. For subsequent payments no 3DS authentication (challenge) is required. This type of transaction is out of scope of the SCA framework. The liability in case of fraud is on the merchant.                                                                                                                                               |
|     RecurringPayment     |        20        | Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) with fixed value: The customer authorizes the merchant to charge for the services/products periodically, typically in case of subscriptions. Subsequent payments are initiated by the merchant and the customer is not present during these payment. Subsequent charges can only be the same or lower as the initial amount. For subsequent payments no 3DS authentication (challenge) is required. This type of transaction can be exempted from the SCA framework. The liability in case of fraud is on the card issuer. In case of this type the RecurringExpiry and RecurringFrequency subfields are mandatory in the PurchaseInformation field. More info: PurchaseInformation |
