|       GooglePay       |           Payment can be completed using GooglePay Note: Only available as guest on capable devices           | Indicates the result of an authorized payment scenario. The result depends on the values of the InitiateRecurrence and RecurrenceId properties supplied in the request. If InitiateRecurrence was true, and a new authorized payment was successfully created, this will be None (because no actual token charge took place yet) If InitiateRecurrence was false, but a previously authorized payment identifier was supplied in RecurrenceId, the system will try to charge the funding source associated with the authorized payment. If this charge is successful, the result is Successful. If the system could not charge the funding source, the result is Failed. If the given identifier is invalid or does not exist, the result is NotFound. In case the payment can not be processed due to lack of 3DS v2 information ThreeDSAuthenticationRequired is returned. In this case, either offsite 3DS v2 authentication should be performed or the TraceId of the initial payment should be sent as well. |     |
